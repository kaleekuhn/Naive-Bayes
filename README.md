We are running this program on Windows. Our IDE is IntelliJ.
First In the main File, under the fileToArrayList Method the File path should be changed from "../project1/data/" to the File path that contains the files to be used in the program.
Next the program should compile and run.
The learning curve is attached in an excel document.
